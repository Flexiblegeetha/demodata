### Exploratory Data Analysis

EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions such as:

1) What is the overall sales trend?
2) Which products are top sellers?
3) What are the peak sales periods?

### Data Analysis

Include some interesting code and features worked with 

--- sql
SELECT * FROM table1
WHERE cond=2;
---

### Results and Finding

Results: The analysis  results are summarized as follows:
- The company's sales have been steadly increasing over the past year, with a noticeable paek during the holiday season.
- Product category A is the best performing category in temrs of sales and revenue.
- Customer segamednts with Lifetime Value LTV should be targeted for marketing efforts.

### Recommendations

 Based on the analysis we recommed the following actions like:
- Invest in the marketing and promotions during peak sales seasons to maximize the revenue.
- Focus on expanding and promoting products in category A.

### Limitations
I had to remove all zero values from budget and revenue columns because they would have afftected the accuracy of my conclusion from the analysis. there are still a few outliers even after the omissions but even then we still see that there is a positive correlation between both budget and number of votes with revenue.
